# transperinealProstate
Helper functions (gridTools), main registration/targeting algorithm (grid), and interfacing script (ProstateGrid) for performing registration and trajectory calculation.

Note that several functions are written 'in-house' to minimize usage of external libraries- this process has since been adapted in JavaScript for implementation RTHawk scanner-interfacing software.

Users will open ProstateGridVX.py with editing software of their choice (Idle, VSCode, etc.) and provide inputs as reported by their scanner. Currently, a set of testing coordinates are saved as defaults in the files.
